    - Rotate the model by a given angle in relation to its X, Y, Z axes.
    - Scale the model by a given value.
- GUI implementation is based on QT library.
- The graphical user interface contains:
    - A button to select the model file and a field to output its name.
    - A visualisation area for the wireframe model.
    - Button/buttons and input fields for translating the model.
    - Button/buttons and input fields for rotating the model.
    - Button/buttons and input fields for scaling the model.
    - Information about the uploaded model - file name, number of vertices and edges.
- The program is implemented using the MVC pattern.
